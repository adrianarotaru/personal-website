2020-12-20	Snoring Detection on a Microcontroller	Snoring is related to a common medical condition that can lead to many serious health issues including diabetes, stroke, and depression. Due to the negative health impacts of such medical condition, it is crucial for people to know whether they snore and understand their snoring patterns and triggers of snoring. In this paper, we propose a bed-side snoring detection program on microcontroller device that automatically identifies snoring sounds.	Rotaru, A., Kelly Zhang, Jiayu Yao (2020).

2020-05-12	Unity Bloxorz Game (Open GL Graphics)	A game akin to Bloxorz in the Unity game engine. The game was built in the 3D framework of the Unity Hub, version 2020.3.6f1. To implement the functioning prototype, I utilized various tools within Unity such as its shader tools, physics engine, scene hierarchy, particle system, lighting engine, and more.
