Me
======

I grew up in Moldova, a small country in Eastern Europe situated at the intersection of two cultures: conservative Russian and traditionalist, but slightly Westernized Romanian. To many people’s surprise, I speak Romanian, I watched Disney growing up, and, like many American teenagers, I was a big fan of The Wizards of Waverly Place, Phineas and Ferb and the Suite Life of Zack and Cody. Still, I was equally drawn to the intense and stoic nature of the Russian people, often indulging into Soviet war-themed movies, chanson and “blatnaya pesnya” music, or even cold plunges, fishing, mud baths, and the delicious pickled fish. 

As much as my lifestyle was influenced equally by the West and the East, so was my gender identity. The way gender inequality manifests itself in the East and West is very different.** *Note: the notion of the West and the East can be different for many people, for the purpose of this essay, the “East” will refer to Eastern Europe - where I lived and studied most of my life - and  “The West” - to Western Europe and the US, where I lived temporarily, traveled, went to college and started a career.*

The East
======
It is widely accepted that the East is more patriarchal overall, and that it fosters a less friendly environment for women’s career growth. Although some of the general data on overall gender equality performance is in support of that view, more detailed data points to the opposite. According to Our World in Data in 2021, the gender inequality index was 0.20 in Moldova and Russia, 0.18 in the USA and 0.08 in France. The index is calculated based on metrics of reproductive health, empowerment and economic status. Moldova seems to rank slightly below the US in terms of overall gender equality, however, when looking at the specific metrics used to calculate the general index, it is no longer as clear. For example, Moldova has a 5.76% gender pay gap compared to 17.65% in the USA, in Moldova abortions are legal, whereas in many US states abortion is criminalized; Moldova has a female president, and the US has never had one. Clearly, there are many other statistics to look at, in order to paint the full picture, and I am not going to advocate for either side, but it is precisely the nature of those differences that I would like to address. I will speak to my gender experience in both geographic bases and try to explain how these differences are reflected in my personal stories. Call it empirical evidence, if you want. That would not undermine its evidentiary importance.  

To better explain these differences, I would like to point out that the claims I am making are generally related to my social interactions as a young adult and professional dynamics as a young woman in science both in the East and the West.

In my high school and early years in Moldova, I was an aspiring young scientist, competing in national and international competitions in Chemistry, Physics, and Biology. I have represented my country at the International Junior Science Olympiad in 2014 and at the International Chemistry Olympiad in 2016. From 2010 to 2016, I have been part of Moldova’s olympic team, have worked with university faculty and research scientists and have conducted research in cardiology at various academic and clinical institutions in the country. Over the course of these years, I have grown to see the gender dynamics from the level of local scientific communities and people of my age to that of high profile academic institutions and of the international scientific community. Throughout these interactions, I have witnessed a wide range of reactions and sentiments towards the women’s involvement in science, from the admiration and adulation of their success, to frustration, tokenism of talented young women, and undermining of women’s success through objectification, or excuses to their success. However, what has been a predominant rhetoric is the feeling of never being or doing ENOUGH. No matter how accomplished I or my female colleagues were, no matter how many medals we would bring home, no matter how much we would beat competition, there was always a “yes, but”. YES, you are incredibly smart, YES you are the only Moldovan person to have been admitted to Harvard that year, YES, you are the first qualified student at the National Selection, BUT, it is your male competitor who I invited to extra preparatory sessions for the upcoming olympiad. It is your male competitor that I sent to participate in that media interview. It is your male competitor that I invited to explain that problem to everyone else. I have confronted teachers over these matters many times and I never got a clear reasoning to the existence of “but”. One time, I went to my physics teacher as to request an explanation as to why she did not put my name on the list for the physics olympiad in 8th grade, after I worked an entire year to prepare for it, and she just gave me a vague: “I was not sure you were interested”.  Furthermore, my friend, Nicoleta, a silver medalist at the International Physics Olympiad, on the other hand, was “teased” in a problematic way by our physics teacher, with regards to the lack of her love life. Because I was so dedicated to studying and was by nature an introvert, denoting a lack of interest in pursuing relationships with males, I was often asked whether I am a lesbian. 

The upfront insults, unapologetic rejections, or rather the overt lack of equitable appreciation generate anger and frustration, but also combat.  Since misogyny in the East is pervasive, it is easier to acknowledge it, but also more conducive to well-justifiable acts of combat. The Eastern European female is led into offense by the society that is so openly adverse to her. She can rightfully become angry and appeal to the universal concept of fairness to justify her aggressive actions, without being silenced or undermined for “overreacting”.  Her response matches the directness of the attack to her rights. As such, I found it much easier to battle pervasive misogyny and I did not realize that until a few years of living in the West.


The West
======
In the West, there is a striking difference to how sexism manifests itself. The discrimination is much more hidden and it happens at a large scale. That explains, partly, why my initial few months in the US were fabulous and liberating. It felt like I was finally in a society that seemed so much more equal and where my opinions mattered. And, only a year or two in, I realized that the adversity is below the surface. In progressive circles in the US, which is where I lived and studied mostly, you would never be openly sexualized, insulted for being a female or straight up told to “shut up”, which occurred on a regular basis in Moldova. Not only is putting up a good image a concept of capitalism and individualistic societies which are more prevalent in the US, than in Moldova, but the freedom of speech movement has become counterintuitive and, has, proven counterintuitive. Condemning hate or discriminatory speech does nothing to people’s real views on matters. The same views, if not expressed through direct speech, can be expressed through indirect actions. If there is anything the US has said loud and clear to me, it is: actions speak louder than words.
